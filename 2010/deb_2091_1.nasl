tag_insight = "SquirrelMail, a webmail application, does not employ a user-specific token
for webforms. This allows a remote attacker to perform a Cross Site Request
Forgery (CSRF) attack. The attacker may hijack the authentication of
unspecified victims and send messages or change user preferences among other
actions, by tricking the victim into following a link controlled by the
offender.

In addition, a denial-of-service was fixed, which could be triggered when a
passwords containing 8-bit characters was used to log in (CVE-2010-2813).

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.15-4+lenny3.1.

For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution (sid),
these problems have been fixed in version 1.4.21-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your squirrelmail packages.";
