tag_insight = "It was discovered that in ejabberd, a distributed XMPP/Jabber server
written in Erlang, a problem in ejabberd_c2s.erl allows remote
authenticated users to cause a denial of service by sending a large
number of c2s (client2server) messages; that triggers an overload of the
queue, which in turn causes a crash of the ejabberd daemon.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.1-6+lenny2.

For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.2-2.

For the testing distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.2-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your ejabberd packages.";
