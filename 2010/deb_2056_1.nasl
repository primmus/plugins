the CGI does not perform sufficient sanitation of user input; an
attacker can take advantage of this and pass script code in order to
perform cross-site scripting attacks.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.4-13lenny1.

For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.1-1.

For the testing distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your zonecheck packages.";
