tag_insight = "It was discovered that in lftp, a command-line HTTP/FTP client, there is
no proper validation of the filename provided by the server through the
Content-Disposition header; attackers can use this flaw by suggesting a
filename they wish to overwrite on the client machine, and then possibly
execute arbitrary code (for instance if the attacker elects to write a
dotfile in a home directory).

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.7.3-1+lenny1.

For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.6-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.6-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your lftp packages.";
