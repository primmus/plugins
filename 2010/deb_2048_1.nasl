tag_insight = "Dan Rosenberg discovered that in dvipng, a utility that converts DVI
files to PNG graphics, several array index errors allow context-dependent
attackers, via a specially crafted DVI file, to cause a denial of
service (crash of the application), and possibly arbitrary code
execution.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version dvipng_1.11-1+lenny1.

For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.13-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.13-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your dvipng package.";
