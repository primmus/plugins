Please find more details at Adobe's site:
http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb09-04.html

Note that Adobe did not provide updates for Adobe Reader 7 as used
on NLD9. We cannot upgrade to newer versions due to library
dependencies. We strongly encourage users of acroread on NLD9 to
uninstall the package and to use an alternative, open source pdf
viewer instead. We're currently evaluating the possibility of
disabling acroread on NLD9 via online update.";
