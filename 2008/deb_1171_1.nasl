announced via advisory DSA 1171-1.

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Ethereal network
scanner, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2006-4333

It was discovered that the Q.2391 dissector is vulnerable to denial
of service caused by memory exhaustion.

CVE-2005-3241

It was discovered that the FC-FCS, RSVP and ISIS-LSP dissectors are
vulnerable to denial of service caused by memory exhaustion.

CVE-2005-3242

It was discovered that the IrDA and SMB dissectors are vulnerable to
denial of service caused by memory corruption.

CVE-2005-3243

It was discovered that the SLIMP3 and AgentX dissectors are vulnerable
to code injection caused by buffer overflows.

CVE-2005-3244

It was discovered that the BER dissector is vulnerable to denial of
service caused by an infinite loop.

CVE-2005-3246

It was discovered that the NCP and RTnet dissectors are vulnerable to
denial of service caused by a null pointer dereference.

CVE-2005-3248

It was discovered that the X11 dissector is vulnerable denial of service
caused by a division through zero.

This update also fixes a 64 bit-specific regression in the ASN.1 decoder, which
has been introduced in a previous DSA.";
