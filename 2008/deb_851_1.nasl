For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in

We recommend that you upgrade your openvpn package.

tag_summary = "The remote host is missing an update to openvpn
announced via advisory DSA 851-1.

Several security related problems have been discovered in openvpn, a
Virtual Private Network daemon.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2005-2531
Wrong processing of failed certificate authentication when running
with verb 0 and without TLS authentication can lead to a denial
of service by disconnecting the wrong client.

CVE-2005-2532
Wrong handling of packets that can't be decrypted on the server
can lead to the disconnection of unrelated clients.

CVE-2005-2533
When running in dev tap Ethernet bridging mode, openvpn can
exhaust its memory by receiving a large number of spoofed MAC
addresses and hence denying service.

CVE-2005-2534
Simultaneous TCP connections from multiple clients with the same
client certificate can cause a denial of service when
--duplicate-cn is not enabled.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain openvpn packages.";
