For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in

We recommend that you upgrade your drupal package.

announced via advisory DSA 958-1.

Several security related problems have been discovered in drupal, a
fully-featured content management/discussion engine.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
vulnerabilities:

CVE-2005-3973

Several cross-site scripting vulnerabilities allow remote
attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

CVE-2005-3974

When running on PHP5, Drupal does not correctly enforce user
privileges, which allows remote attackers to bypass the access
user profiles permission.

CVE-2005-3975

An interpretation conflict allows remote authenticated users to
inject arbitrary web script or HTML via HTML in a file with a GIF
or JPEG file extension.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain drupal packages.";
